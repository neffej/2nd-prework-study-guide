# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This is a study guide for myself and others to use as we introduce ourselves to the basics of web development

I built this project in order to gain experience in the basics of web development and also to create a repository of some of the notes and concepts that I've learned along the way

The project provides an online home for my study notes, which means I can access them from anywhere with a variety of devices and also share the information to others interested in the subject.

I learned a lot!  Every piece of this project apart from the use of the English language is new to me, so it has been an excellent introduction to Github, HTML, CSS and JS.  For added context, managing Git workflow is so far the least intuitive coding process I've encountered, but I'm looking forward to it becoming second nature!

## Usage

This is an instructional tool and it's main use is to convey information.  It contains notes on the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.  

One can see JavaScript running by opening the console.  It will display a list of topics and it will also randomly suggest a topic to study first. Neat!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
